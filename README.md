# 🚢 CodeAlpha Internship - Task 2: Titanic EDA  

📌 **Project Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset  
👩‍💻 **Internship Domain:** Data Analytics (CodeAlpha)  
📅 **Task Completed:** October 2025  

---

## 🔎 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset (`titanic_dataset.csv`).  
The goal is to explore the dataset, clean the data, and generate insights using **visualization and statistical analysis**.  

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).  
   - Checking duplicates and correcting data types.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Survival distribution by gender, passenger class, and age.  
   - Correlation heatmap of numeric features.  
   - Distribution plots and boxplots to detect patterns.  

3. **Visualizations**
   - Countplots for gender and class survival.  
   - Histograms for age and fare.  
   - Heatmap for correlation.  

---

## ✅ Key Insights
- **Women had a much higher survival rate** than men.  
- **1st Class passengers** survived more often than 2nd and 3rd Class.  
- **Children under 10** had higher chances of survival compared to adults.  
- Fare was positively correlated with survival (wealthier passengers had better chances).
